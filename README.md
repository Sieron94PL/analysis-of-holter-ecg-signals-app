# Analysis of Holter ECG Signals - JavaFX application

Master thesis topic: "An application for the analysis of Holter ECG signals"

Purpose and scope of work: Main goal of this thesis is to design application to presenting ECG signal waveform based on Holter data, R-peak detecting and calculating parameters: HR(Heart Rate), HRV(Heart Rate Variability), HRT(Heart Rate Turbulence), SDNN, DC(Deceleration) and AC(Acceleration).

Basic functionalities:
* possibility to loading data from Holter (DAT format)
* viewing ECG waveform
* R-peak detecting (based on Pan-Tompkins algorithm)
* Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVC) detecting
* analyzing Heart Rate Variability (HRV) on chart
* appointing parameters: HR, HRT, HRV, SDNN, DC, AC
